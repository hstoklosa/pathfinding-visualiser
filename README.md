# üîç Pathfinding Visualiser

Pathfinding Visualiser is an interactive web application that demonstrates various pathfinding algorithms in action. This tool helps users understand and compare the performance of different algorithms, such as A\*, Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS, by visualising their execution on a grid.

## Features

-   Interactive grid-based interface
-   Obstacle generation
-   Visualise searching algorithms:
    -   Dijkstra's Algorithm
    -   A\* Search Algorithm
    -   Breadth-First Search Algorithm
    -   Depth-First Search Algorithm
-   Real-time animation of algorithm steps
-   Adjustable speed of the pathfinding algorithms
-   Clear and reset functionalities
-   Responsive design for various screen sizes
